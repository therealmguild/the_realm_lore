The realm is a new guild that was founded by Jakobi Valmeister, a retired adventurer. It is a modest guild with a few dozen members but not many of note. Most are relegated to mundane tasks as couriers or simple bodies-for-hire.

Jakobu wishes to mentor the next generation of adventures and has sent fliers all across the sword coast for those with a taste of adventure and a sensible moral compass to join him at his guild, The Realm.
