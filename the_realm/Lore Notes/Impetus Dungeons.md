Magical dungeons and the main draw to many adventurers to [[Contria]]. There is rumor that there is a cause to these dungeons, a mad mage, a bored god of creation, or even the pursuit of pure adventure for its own sake. Little it known to the why, but many have pieced together that these can spawn anywhere and vary in both risk and reward. Some are full of mystery until the depths are explored and others are full history and seem to be pulled from history itself. Once the final treasure of a dungeon has been looted, it will collapse into the earth and return from nothing.
